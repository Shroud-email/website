Today we're releasing an exciting new feature: as of today, you can bring your own domain to your Shroud.email aliases.

[Custom domains](/docs/product/custom-domains/) let you use any domain(s) you own to create email aliases such as `substack@mydomain.com`. This means that you retain control of your aliases -- you can always leave Shroud.email and set up those aliases somewhere else.

Once you've added and verified your domain, you can create custom email aliases:

That's it! Now you can send and receive emails with your custom email alias.

But that's not all. Once you've set up your domain, you can choose to enable catch-all. If you do this, you don't even need to create aliases manually! Any email sent to an address on your domain with automatically create the alias if it doesn't already exist.

With catchall, you no longer need to visit Shroud.email to use aliases. Instead, you can just make up an alias on the spot whenever a website asks for one!

We're really excited about custom domains, and we hope you find them useful!
