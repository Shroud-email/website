We're excited to announce Shroud.email: a tool to hide your email address from creepy spammers and marketers and block spy pixels.

Your email address is essentially your ID on the web. Unfortunately, **it can used to track you across the Internet**. Marketing companies can buy lists of emails by demographic or interest and use it to send you unsolicited spam, or to cross-reference with other data to build a profile on you. And maybe a webshop you used will get hacked one day, and suddenly everyone can see that you're still buying beanie babies in 2021.

And it gets worse. **Many email senders use spy pixels** to track when you open an email, when you re-open it, where you were when you opened it, and what kind of device you were using. These spy pixels are hidden, so you don't even know when it happens.

Shroud.email was made to fix these problems. Email isn't going away, and we need tools that help us reclaim our privacy on the web. Shroud.email lets you **hide your real email** by giving you aliases that forward emails to you. And we **block trackers** in these emails, so you can rest easy knowing that no-one but you knows about your email-reading habits.

Shroud.email comes with a 30-day free trial. You can [sign up here](https://app.shroud.email/users/register).
