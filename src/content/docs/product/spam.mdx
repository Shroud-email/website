import Alert from "~/components/atoms/Alert.astro";

As an email server, we need to be cautious about forwarding spam to your mailbox. If one of your aliases
receives a spam email and we forwarded it, then it would harm our reputation as a sender, leading to
lower deliverability rates for legitimate emails.

Instead, if we detect a spam email, we will store it for 7 days and notify you. You can then view the email in our
web portal and take appropriate actions.

<Alert
  intent="info"
  text="Shroud.email will only store emails in two circumstances: if it's spam, or if you've asked us to enable email logging for debugging purposes."

## I'm receiving spam emails. What do I do?

If one of your aliases starts receiving spam, you have a few options. The first option is the most effective: simply delete or disable the alias. Now it's as if it never existed, and the spammers aren't able to get your attention.

The second option is to block the specific sender that's spamming you. This only works in cases where the spam is originating only from a few addresses. On the spam page on Shroud.email, it's easy to block the sender of a spam email
using the "block sender" button:

## One of my outgoing emails was marked as spam. What do I do?

We also prevent sending spam emails _from_ your aliases. We use industry-standard spam detection systems, but they
aren't always perfect.

If one of your legitimate emails was marked as spam, the easiest step is to try again -- perhaps making sure you aren't using common spam phrases like "incredible deal" or "meet singles". Short test emails are also often marked as spam.

If that still doesn't work, you can <a href="mailto:contact@shroud.email">contact us</a>.
